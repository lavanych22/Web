            </div>

                <p>Swimming is an individual or team sport that requires the use of one's arms and legs to move the body through water. The sport takes place in pools or open water (e.g., in a sea or lake). Competitive swimming is one of the most popular Olympic sports,[1] with varied distance events in butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke, freestyle, and individual medley. In addition to these individual events, four swimmers can take part in either a freestyle or medley relay. A medley relay consists of four swimmers who will each swim a different stroke. The order for a medley relay is: backstroke, breaststroke, butterfly, and freestyle. Swimming each stroke requires a set of specific techniques, and in competition, there are distinct regulations concerning the acceptable form for each individual stroke.[2] There are also regulations on what types of swimsuits, caps, jewelry and injury tape that are allowed at competitions.[3] Although it is possible for competitive swimmers to incur several injuries from the sport, such as tendinitis in the shoulders or knees, there are also multiple health benefits associated with the sport.

                <p>In the beginning, the formula was largely based on pre-World War II regulations defined by engine
                    capacity. The regulation expected to bring a new balance between supercharged and normally aspirated
                    cars. Non-supercharged 4.5-litre pre-war Grand Prix cars were allowed to race against the pre-war
                    1.5-litre supercharged 'voiturettes', while pre-war supercharged 3-litre Grand Prix cars were
                    banned. The first race under the new regulations was the 1946 Turin Grand Prix held on 1 September,
                    the race being won by Achille Varzi in an Alfa Romeo 158 Alfetta.

                    Competitive swimming became popular in the 19th century. The goal of high level competitive swimming is to break personal or world records while beating competitors in any given event. Swimming in competition should create the least resistance in order to obtain maximum speed. However, some professional swimmers who do not hold a national or world ranking are considered the best in regard to their technical skills. Typically, an athlete goes through a cycle of training in which the body is overloaded with work in the beginning and middle segments of the cycle, and then the workload is decreased in the final stage as the swimmer approaches competition.
